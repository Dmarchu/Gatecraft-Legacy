# Gatecraft-Legacy
One of my first projects on Java, focused on learning about the usage of logical gates and basic electronics.

# Features
This is the first version of GateCraft: Logical gates master. It has some features such as a java default gui to develop logical circuits, saving projects, import projects and run the circuits as a preview.
